#!!!@Ansible!!!

Ansible is a medium of operating multiple machines simultaneously. The best example is Opearting m/c at some org.
Like if I want to install mariadb over our machines then it would be more handy to do it using Ansible rather than installing mariadb on every machine individually.


#!!!Ad-hoc Commands!!!

Ad-hoc commands are inline commands that are used only for few operations or say operations that are not frequent. 
These ad-hoc commands requires 'hostname' (set the host name in /etc/hosts) 'modules' or by default it is command 'arguments' and 'command that is to be performed'.

#!!!For Example!!!
	ansible localhost -m (module) ping
	(to see the actual command prefer Ad-hoc folder within the same repo).
	If Everything goes well then it would Result as: "ping":"pong"
